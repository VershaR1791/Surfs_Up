# Surfs_Up
Use SQLite and SQLAlchemy for investor analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
In order to set up a new Surf n Shake shop (a surfing rental and ice cream) in Oahu, Hawaii we need to prove to the investors W.Avy that it is a good decision based on the weather conditions. Using Advanced Data Storage & Retrieval we must analyze the weather data to prove to W.Avy that the Surf shop would be a great investment.

## Results: 
- Here are snapshots of the statistics of temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii in the month of June and December:

    - The data samples is more for the month of June than December.
    - The standard deviation for December is greater than the month of June.
    - The minimum temperature for December is significantly lower than the one for month of June.
     
## Summary: 
- There isn't a significant change or difference in the mean and maximum temperatures in the month of June and December indicating that the weather remains almost same in the peak winter and summer months.
- The quartile range for both analysis also do not have a significant gap in their temperature values indicating a similar distribution curve.
- However, the datapoints are more for June than December indicating possibly missing data and it could probably skew the statistics of the month of December.
- It is also important to compare the precipitation data in the months of June and December because it is a key decision to understand how rainfall will affect the Surf Shop's business.
- Additionally, to solidify our analysis we should look at weather data of 2 other months such as July and January to get a better understanding of weather throughout the year.
